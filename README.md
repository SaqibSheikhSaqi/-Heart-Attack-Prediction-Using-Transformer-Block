A state of art deep learning method is developed with the combination of dense, transformer-block, global average pooling and dropout layer to detect heart attack risk. 

The dataset, downloaded from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset/data", contains records for 8,763 patients with 26 attributes. We excluded the attributes for country, continent, hemisphere, and patient ID, as they were not needed for training.
